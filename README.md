## Generate a new HTML5 template page to use in your project in a matter of seconds.

**Check the live version [here](https://chalarangelo.github.io/htmltemplategenerator/).**

I found the lack of proper HTML5 templates disturbing, thus I set up this simple generator to save myself (and hopefully others) some time when starting a new project or page or even when testing some styles or scripts. The list of features is not very long yet, but it will expand eventually to include some more useful things (i.e. jQuery inclusion and sample code generation).

## Use

Go to the live version, follow the instructions, get your template, use it in all your projects.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute your own templates:

1. Fork into your account.
2. Branch into a template branch `template/your_template`.
3. Add a file named `your_template.txt` with a statement `var templateText = '...'` including the whole sample page's text, formatted similarly to the templates that are already included in the generator.
4. Push to your fork and submit an issue to this repository with the label `template submission` under the `template submissions` milestone, including a short description of your template and a link to the `your_template.txt` file.

Template submissions will be reviewed as soon as possible and included in the next stable release. 

If you want to update your template submission, submit a new issue to this repository with the label `enhancement`, including a link to the `your_template.txt` file in its latest version and a short changelog since the last version.
